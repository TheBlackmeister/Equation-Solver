# Equation-Solver
This is my project for grammar school IT class, 2019.

It can solve difficult linear equations, matrixes with Gauss-Elimination method and can use the Cramer method for matrix 3x3. 

It supports reading coefficients from a file, can randomly generate coefficients or you can manually write your own equations.

It also supports writing matrixes and their answers into a file.
